### 🎓 Education
* **B.S. in Systems & IT Engineering** | Universidad del Valle de Atemajac (UNIVA) | *2025 - Present*
* **Mechatronics Engineering** | Instituto Tecnológico de Tepic | *2021-2024*

Engineering student building a strong foundation in backend systems and secure infrastructure. My focus lies at the intersection of Linux environments, automation, and the deployment of local AI solutions. With a background in Mechatronics, I apply analytical rigor to build scalable, security-first applications.

### 🗺️ Professional Roadmap (2026–2027)

* Phase 1 [The Foundation]: Mastering the Linux CLI, version control with Git, and Python logic. Transitioning from academic exercises to structured projects.
* Phase 2 [The Backend]: Understanding how data flows. Learning SQL, basic API design (FastAPI/Flask), and how to document technical requirements.
* Phase 3 [The Environment]: Introduction to Virtualization and Containers (Docker). Learning to deploy my own projects in a consistent environment.
* Phase 4 [Security Awareness]: Developing a Security-First mindset. Learning to identify common vulnerabilities (OWASP) and applying basic hardening to my local Linux servers.

### 🚀 Featured Project: Technical Analyst AI (TAAI)
**An offline framework for analyzing technical documents using local AI models.**

* **The Problem:** Technical documentation can be difficult to review, and cloud AI tools may raise data privacy concerns.
* **The Solution:** A Python CLI tool that uses local LLMs to summarize documents and assist with requirements analysis in a fully local environment.
* **Purpose:** Designed to support students and engineers working with sensitive documentation.
* **Current Status:** Phase 1 — Designing the architecture and building the CLI.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, Linux & Local LLM deployment and orchestration.
